2. **README.md Created**: A comprehensive README.md file has been created with information about:
   - Project structure
   - Technology stack
   - Prerequisites
   - Running instructions
   - Development commands

3. **GitHub Setup Instructions**: A detailed GITHUB_SETUP.md file has been created with step-by-step instructions on:

   - Linking your local repository to GitHub
   - Committing your changes
   - Pushing your code to GitHub
   - Verifying your repository
   - Using semantic commits for clear and meaningful commit messages

4. **Files Added to Git**: The README.md and GITHUB_SETUP.md files have been added to git staging.

## Next Steps

To complete the GitHub repository setup, please follow these steps:

1. **Review the Files**:

   - Review the GITHUB_SETUP.md for the detailed instructions

2. **Follow the GitHub Setup Instructions**:
