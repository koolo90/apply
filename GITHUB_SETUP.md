# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and push your existing code:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., "apply-backend")
4. Optionally, add a description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. **Important**: Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license as you already have an existing project
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Verify that the remote was added successfully
git remote -v
```

## 3. Commit Your Changes

Before pushing to GitHub, make sure to commit all your changes:

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 4. Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 5. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository page (https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME)
2. Confirm that all your files have been uploaded correctly
3. Your README.md should be displayed on the repository's main page

## Additional Tips

- Consider setting up branch protection rules for your main branch
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed
- Invite collaborators to your repository if you're working with a team
